# The Escapists Reincarcerated Repository

This is the repository for The Escapists Reincarcerated.

Requirements for CTFAK to work properly: 
.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime, .NET 6.0 Runtime, and ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0 : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

The CTFAK 2.0 GitHub page can be found here: https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0 (you do NOT have to download this)

Discord: https://discord.gg/PEzv5ECNgR

For fully built and "stable" releases, go to the "Releases" section.

The source code presented in the ```main``` branch is stuff pushed daily, and will not be the same as what is seen in the released versions most of the time.

## Changing your The Escapists folder directory

The game will not get past the loading screen if you do not have a valid path for The Escapists.

In the root of the The Escapists Reincarcerated directory, go to this folder: "The Escapists Reincarcerated_Data/StreamingAssets/CTFAK".

In this folder, go into the "config.ini" file to change the directory of your The Escapists folder path at "GameFolderPath" under "Settings" in that file. 

YOU MUST USE FORWARD SLASHES (/) INSTEAD OF BACK SLASHES (\\), AND YOU ALSO MUST PUT QUOTES AROUND THE PATH.

Example path: "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/The Escapists"
