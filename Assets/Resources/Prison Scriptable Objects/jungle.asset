  wardenNote: Welcome to the jungle!\n\nSociety has declared you a menace, so we've
    put you far away from any trace of it.\n\nBefore you even entertain the thought
    of escaping, let me remind you that even if by some remote chance you make it
    past the fence, the wall, the perimeter jeeps and the guard checkpoint, there's
    no surviving out in the wild beyond...
