  wardenNote: Dear Client,\n\nThe trial was a farce, but as you can see, I was able
    to pull some last minut strings with my good friend the Judge and get you sent
    to 'summer camp'.\n\nHow do you like the place? Nice little quiet spot by the
    lake, like you always wanted, right? They've forecast a great summer, so enjoy!\n\nLou
    Pole\nAttorney At Law
