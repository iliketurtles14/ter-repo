  wardenNote: After escaping Santa's Sweatshop, $name lost control of the sleigh
    mid-flight and was forced to make an emergency crash landing. Ironically, this
    landing was within the grounds of Jingle Cells Prison!\n\nThe other inmates don't
    believe $name's story, they think he's crazy. Now he's doing hard time with the
    rest of them.\n\nOnly one thing to do - repair the sleigh and fly out of there!
