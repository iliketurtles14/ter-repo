  wardenNote: Well I never! Of all the prisons in all the world, you went and landed
    yourself in mine.\n\nNow, I really don't want to dampen your spirits seeing as
    though you're the new guy around here, but the fact is you will NEVER leave this
    island. What's left of your pitiful existence will be spent with me and my boys
    here in The Rock.\n\nEnjoy your stay, punk...

  - Hello $name.\n\nI got your message, and I must say it's quite a risky thing to
    ask! My job is to ferry prisoners TO the island, not AWAY.\n\nHowever, $250 might
    change my mind... Bring the cash to the dock during my night shift and I'll smuggle
    you to the mainland.\n\nBig Hugs,\nOfficer Birdseye x
