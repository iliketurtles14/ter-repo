  wardenNote: Listen here maggot.\n\nYou know why you're here so no point crying
    about it. Generally feared as the highest security prison ever, HMP Irongate
    is where you'll live out the rest of your meaningless existence.\n\nEscape you
    say? Don't make me laugh! The handful of idiots who tried met a watery demise
    trying to swim off the island. Still, chin up eh?
