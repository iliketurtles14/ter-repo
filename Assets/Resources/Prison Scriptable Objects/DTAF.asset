  wardenNote: Pay attention Agent $name...\n\nYou'll need to put together some high-tech
    equipment to launch yourself out of this one!\n\nWe've recieved the attached
    photo and the keywords 'sharks' and 'hammers' from a former agent. Hopefully
    this intel will be of some help.\n\nGood luck, we're counting on you!
