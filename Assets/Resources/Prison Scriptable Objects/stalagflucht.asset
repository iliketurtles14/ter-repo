  wardenNote: Sent me another one have they?..\n\nListen $name, I don't have to remind
    you that Stalag Flucht is famous for housing inmates with a record of escapism,
    so if you're planning on getting out of this one, think again!\n\nNow get yourself
    settled in, it's going to be a cold, long winter.
